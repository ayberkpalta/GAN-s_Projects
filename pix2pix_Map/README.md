ðŸ§  Model Purpose
This Pix2Pix model is designed for image-to-image translation tasks, 
uch as transforming satellite images into map-like visuals. It uses paired datasets to learn the mapping from input to output images.

To improve the modelâ€™s performance, it is recommended to increase the number of training epochs (e.g., to 10 or more) and experiment with different batch sizes (e.g., 4, 8, or 16). 
These changes help the model learn more robust and detailed features.
